Usage: callgraph <foo.c >foo.dot
(then dot -Tps <foo.dot >foo.ps)

Reads the input as (idiomatic) C code, heuristically, and graphs
functions defined and calls made between those functions.

Functions which might be called from outside of the file,
i.e. non-static functions, are highlighted with a box and
pulled out to the left-hand side.
